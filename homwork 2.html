  <h1><u>History of this game series</u></h1><br>
  <h5>The Need for Speed series was originally developed by Distinctive Software, a video game studio based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Prior to Electronic Arts(EA) purchase of the company in 1991, it had created popular racing games such as Stunts and Test Drive II: The Duel. After the purchase, the company was renamed Electronic Arts (EA) Canada. The company capitalized on its experience in the domain by developing the Need for Speed series in late 1992.EA Canada continued to develop and expand the Need for Speed franchise up to 2002, when another Vancouver-based developer, named Black Box Games, was acquired by EA and contracted to continue the series with Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.</h5><br>

  <n><u>The Need for Speed (1994)</u></n>
<h5>The original Need for Speed was released for 3DO in 1994 with versions released for the PC (DOS) (1995), PlayStation and Saturn (1996) following shortly afterwards. The Need for Speed and its Special Edition were the only games in the series to support DOS, with subsequent releases for the PC running only on Windows (excluding Need for Speed: Carbon which was also released on Mac OS X).</h5>
<h5>The first installment of The Need for Speed was the only serious attempt by the series to provide a realistic simulation of car handling elements through the direct collaboration of Staff members from Road & Track. Electronic Arts left the handling dynamics tuning with the automotive magazine's seasoned drivers to match vehicle behavior including realistic over and understeer that remains impressive decades later, as well as sounds made by the vehicles' gear control levers and other functions. The game contained vehicle data with spoken commentary, several "magazine-style" images of each car, and short video clips highlighting the vehicles set to music. Most cars and tracks are available at the beginning of the game, and the objective is to unlock the remaining locked content by winning tournaments. This version featured chases by police cars, a popular theme throughout the series.</h5>

  <h1><u>Evolution of this game series</u></h1>
<h5>The Need for Speed (NFS) series has been the benchmark for arcade racing games ever since the first title in the iconic franchise was released in 1994. From offering jaw-dropping supercars to allowing players to drive through picturesque locations, Need for Speed games have never failed to thrill its players.
  With every new title, EA has improved the Need for Speed games in terms of visual fidelity and the sheer quality of the gameplay on offer.
  While the series has gone through some rough years, especially during the eighth console generation, it has made a major comeback with its most recent entries such as Need for Speed Heat and Need for Speed Unbound.</h5>

    <td><h5> Need for Speed: Most Wanted</h5></td>
    <td><h5> 2012</h5></td>
    <td><h5>PC, PS3, Xbox 360</h5></td>
    <td><h5>If you’re not that big of a fan of customization and just want to indulge yourself in fast races around a highly destructible city, Need for Speed: Most Wanted is the one for you. It sets itself apart from the 2005 entry of the same game and instead looks to provide the mayhem that is akin to the Burnout games, with the cop chasing that we all have grown to love from this series. As an interesting feature, there’s no menus or lobbies. You can access everything on the fly without letting your hands off the wheel, making Most Wanted one of the most straightforward and intense experiences in this list.</h5></td>
   </tr> 
   <tr>
    <td><h5>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit</h5></td>
    <td><h5>2010</h5></td>
    <td><h5>PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch</h5></td>
    <td><h5>Introduced as the first Need for Speed developed by Criterion Games, known for the Burnout series, Hot Pursuit looks away from live-action cutscenes and car customization. Here, you have an overworld and set of races that appear over time, and not much else. The focus is on delivering fast-paced races either as a racer or as a cop, performing bounties, challenges, and even comparing yourself to others online with Autolog, a system that links friends directly to each other’s games to create new milestones. If you’re only interested in grabbing a fast car and driving through the highway at high speed, this is the entry for you.</h5></td>

   <tr>
    <td><h5>Need for Speed Heat</h5></td>
    <td><h5> 2019</h5></td>
    <td><h5>PC, PS4, Xbox One</h5></td>
    <td><h5>Developed by Ghost Games and released in late 2019, Need for Speed Heat is one of the latest entries in the series, and certainly one that respects the series’ roots. Its biggest highlight is the possibility of day and night races, which have their own rules and conditions. Whilst driving in the sunlight will let you stand toe to toe with racers in official tournaments, taking your Dodge Racer to the night will allow you to compete in illegal encounters, with the addition of police chases that can become brutal real fast. There’s also customization for both your cars and your avatar, a huge open-world map to explore, and yet another storyline to follow through</h5></td>

<tr>
  <td><h5>Need for Speed Rivals</h5></td>
  <td><h5>2013</h5></td>
  <td><h5> PC, PS4, Xbox One</h5></td>
  <td><h5>Criterion Software came with Need for Speed Rivals in 2013, an intricate entry in the series that aims to erase the line between single and multiplayer by creating a seamless online world. Here, you are constantly on the edge of your seat due to one of the most aggressive and smart police AI, using all sorts of tools to take you down. As a racer, you can be out there on your own (there’s also an option to use bots instead of playing online) but as a cop, you’ll band in teams to make for some of the most intense pursuits in racing games.

  <h1><u> My Opinion</h1></u>
<ol type="1">
<li><a>Acoording to me need for speed is my favourite game,because i like the story line of this game series.There are many more car games like Froza horizon,project cars,Grand tourismo and many more,
  but there isn't having a story line for those games.But in NFS series,there are having good story line for each games.</a></li>
  <li><a>But i must say Graphics in froza horizon way more realistic and way more better than the NFS series and it cannot be compared 
    to nfs series.Froza horizon is having best graphics but there is no such good story line like in the NFS games.  </li></a>
